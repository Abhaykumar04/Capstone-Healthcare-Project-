# Capstone-Healthcare-Project-

### This healthcare project aims to predict the onset of diabetes using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project consists of several features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and outcome.

### Data Visualization

Before building the machine learning models, we first explored the dataset using data visualization techniques. We plotted histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to gain insights into the distribution of our features and their relationships with each other. These visualizations helped us identify potential outliers and understand the underlying relationships between the features.

### Logistic Regression

After visualizing the data, we built a logistic regression model to predict diabetes onset. We used a stratified K-fold cross-validation technique to evaluate the performance of our model.

### Decision Tree Classifier

We then applied a decision tree classifier to the dataset. We used a grid search cross-validation technique to tune the hyperparameters of the model.We also visualized the decision tree using the graphviz library to understand the underlying structure of the model.

### Random Forest
Next, we applied a random forest classifier to the dataset. We used a randomized search cross-validation technique to tune the hyperparameters of the model. We also plotted a feature importance chart to understand which features were the most important in predicting diabetes onset.

### Support Vector Classifier
We applied a support vector classifier to the dataset. We used a grid search cross-validation technique to tune the hyperparameters of the model. We also plotted a confusion matrix to understand the true positive and false positive rates of our model.

### K-NN
Finally, we applied a K-NN classifier to the dataset. We used a grid search cross-validation technique to tune the hyperparameters of the model.We also plotted a precision-recall curve to visualize the performance of our model.

## Conclusion
In conclusion the results of this project can be used by healthcare professionals to develop preventative measures for patients at high risk of developing diabetes. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in improving healthcare outcomes.
